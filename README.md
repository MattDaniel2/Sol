## Explorer Program
The Explorer Program encompasses my prototyping efforts across vehicle GN&C, science experiments, and data-driven planning. This branch will work across the three projects to explore basic ways to
  - Test components from the launch site
  - Activate, record, and transmit or recover scientific experiments
  - Log vehicle lifetime telemetry and perform rudimentary analysis on it
  
There will be a `Proto` launch-vehicle family designed and constructed for the Explorer program as well as related test-stations and platforms
